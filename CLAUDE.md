## Overview

This is a simple yearly learning plan broken down by week. My goal is to set forth a learning plan that I can follow and share with colleagues to inspire a learning culture with those around me.

## Objective

Keep the format clean. There is a header that gives information about the learning plan followed by entries by week. Here is the basic plan:

```
