# Learning Plan

A public yearly learning plan, broken down week-by-week, to track personal growth and inspire a learning culture with colleagues.

## Structure

```
learning-plan/
├── learning-plan.md   # The main plan: milestones, weekly focus areas, and status
├── notes/             # Notes, write-ups, and outputs linked from the plan
└── CLAUDE.md          # Instructions for AI-assisted plan maintenance
```

## How It Works

- **Cadence:** Weekly focus areas with a defined topic and source materials
- **Deliverables:** Notes, blog posts, or YouTube videos
- **Accountability:** Shared with colleagues and reviewed in 1-on-1s
- **Statuses:** `Planned` → `In Progress` → `Done` (or `Moved` / `Dropped`)

## Current Plan
